# HHFtools

HHFtools is a set of modular calculation tools written in Python3 which can be
used to provide first order estimates of thermofluid performance including
convective heat transfer and pressure drop for simple high heat flux
components. Heat transfer coefficients are calculated using the same set of
equations as has been used for ITER divertor and first wall design with
parameters for simple tubes, swirl tape inserts, rectangular channels, and
hypervapotrons. Similar tools are partially developed for pin-fin arrays and
multiple small channels in parallel.
